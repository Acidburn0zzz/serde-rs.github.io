 \nSerde\nSerde is a framework for serializing and deserializing Rust data\nstructures efficiently and generically.\nThe Serde ecosystem consists of data structures that know how to serialize and\ndeserialize themselves along with data formats that know how to serialize and\ndeserialize other things. Serde provides the layer by which these two groups\ninteract with each other, allowing any supported data structure to be serialized\nand deserialized using any supported data format.\nDesign\nWhere many other languages rely on runtime reflection for serializing data,\nSerde is instead built on Rust's powerful trait system. A data structure that\nknows how to serialize and deserialize itself is one that implements Serde's\nSerialize and Deserialize traits (or uses Serde's code generation to\nautomatically derive implementations at compile time). This avoids any overhead\nof reflection or runtime type information. In fact in many situations the\ninteraction between data structure and data format can be completely optimized\naway by the Rust compiler, leaving Serde serialization to perform roughly the\nsame speed as a handwritten serializer for the specific selection of data\nstructure and data format.\nData formats\nThe following is a partial list of data formats that have been implemented for\nSerde by the community.\n\nJSON, the ubiquitous JavaScript Object\nNotation used by many HTTP APIs.\nBincode, a compact binary format used\nfor IPC within the Servo rendering engine.\nCBOR, a Concise Binary Object\nRepresentation designed for small message size without the need for version\nnegotiation.\nYAML, a popular human-friendly\nconfiguration language that ain't markup language.\nMessagePack, an efficient binary\nformat that resembles a compact JSON.\nTOML, a minimal configuration\nformat used by Cargo.\nPickle, a format common in the\nPython world.\nHjson, a variant of JSON designed to\nbe readable and writable by humans.\nBSON, the data storage and network\ntransfer format used by MongoDB.\nURL, the x-www-form-urlencoded\nformat.\nXML, the flexible machine-friendly W3C\nstandard. (deserialization only)\nEnvy, a way to deserialize environment\nvariables into Rust structs. (deserialization only)\nRedis, deserialize values from\nRedis when using redis-rs.\n(deserialization only)\n\nData structures\nOut of the box, Serde is able to serialize and deserialize common Rust data\ntypes in any of the above formats. For example String, &str, usize,\nVec, HashMap are all supported. In addition, Serde provides code\ngeneration to #[derive] serialization implementations for structs in your own\nprogram. Using the code generation goes like this:\n#[macro_use]\nextern crate serde_derive;\n\nextern crate serde_json;\n\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\nstruct Point {\n    x: i32,\n    y: i32,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let point = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };\n\n    // Convert the Point to a JSON string.\n    let serialized = serde_json::to_string(&point).unwrap();\n\n    // Prints serialized = {\"x\":1,\"y\":2}\n    println!(\"serialized = {}\", serialized);\n\n    // Convert the JSON string back to a Point.\n    let deserialized: Point = serde_json::from_str(&serialized).unwrap();\n\n    // Prints deserialized = Point { x: 1, y: 2 }\n    println!(\"deserialized = {:?}\", deserialized);\n}\n\n"},"help.html":{"url":"help.html","title":"Help","keywords":"","body":"Getting help\nSerde developers live in the #serde channel on\nirc.mozilla.org. The #rust channel is also a\ngood resource with generally faster response time but less specific knowledge\nabout Serde. If IRC is not your thing, we are happy to respond to GitHub\nissues as well.\n"},"codegen.html":{"url":"codegen.html","title":"Setting up codegen","keywords":"","body":"Setting up codegen\nSerde provides code generation to generate implementations of the Serialize\nand Deserialize traits for structs defined in your crate, allowing them to be\nused conveniently with all of Serde's data formats.\nYou only need codegen if your code is using #[derive(Serialize,\nDeserialize)]\nCodegen is based on Rust's #[derive] mechanism, just like what you would use\nto automatically derive implementations of the built-in Clone, Copy, or\nDebug traits.

For example you could serialize a C-like enum\nas a primitive number.\nSerializing a sequence or map\nComplex types follow a three-step process of init, elements, end. The Serializer\ngets to keep track of some state which the Serialize implementation is\nresponsible for passing to each method.\nimpl Serialize for Vec\n    where T: Serialize\n{\n    fn serialize(&self, serializer: S) -> Result\n        where S: Serializer\n    {\n        let mut seq = serializer.serialize_seq(Some(self.len()))?;\n        for e in self {\n            seq.serialize_element(e)?;\n        }\n        serializer.end()\n    }\n}\n\nSerializing a map works the same way but with separate calls\nin the loop for serialize_map_key and serialize_map_value.\nSerializing a struct\nSerde distinguishes between four types of structs. Ordinary\nstructs and tuple\nstructs follow the\nthree-step process of init, elements, end just like a sequence or map. Newtype\nstructs and unit\nstructs are more\nlike primitives.\nData formats are encouraged to treat newtype structs as insignificant wrappers\naround the inner value, serializing just the inner value. See for example\nJSON's treatment of newtype structs.\n// An ordinary struct. Use three-step process:\n//   1. serialize_struct\n//   2. serialize_struct_elt\n//   3. serialize_struct_end\nstruct Color {\n    r: u8,\n    g: u8,\n    b: u8,\n}\n\n// A tuple struct. Use three-step process:\n//   1. serialize_tuple_struct\n//   2. serialize_tuple_struct_elt\n//   3. serialize_tuple_struct_end\nstruct Point2D(f64, f64);\n\n// A newtype struct. Use serialize_newtype_struct.\nstruct Inches(u64);\n\n// A unit struct. Use serialize_unit_struct.\nstruct Instance;\n\nSerializing an enum\nSerializing enum variants is very similar to serializing structs.\nenum E {\n    // Use three-step process:\n    //   1. serialize_struct_variant\n    //   2. serialize_struct_variant_elt\n    //   3. serialize_struct_variant_end\n    Color { r: u8, g: u8, b: u8 },\n\n    // Use three-step process:\n    //   1. serialize_tuple_variant\n    //   2. serialize_tuple_variant_elt\n    //   3. serialize_tuple_variant_end\n    Point2D(f64, f64),\n\n    // Use serialize_newtype_variant.\n    Inches(u64),\n\n    // Use serialize_unit_variant.\n    Instance,\n}\n\nOther special cases\nThere are three more special cases that are part of the Serializer trait.\nThere is a method serialize_bytes which serializes a &[u8]. Some formats\ntreat bytes like any other seq, but some formats are able to serialize bytes\nmore compactly. Currently Serde does not use serialize_bytes in the\nSerialize impl for &[u8] or Vec but once\nspecialization lands in stable\nRust we will begin using it. For now the\nBytes and\nByteBuf wrappers can\nbe used to wrap &[u8] and Vec respectively to call serialize_bytes.\nThere is serialize_seq_fixed_size which is like serialize_seq but for\nsequences where the length does not need to be serialized because it will be\nknown at deserialization time. The usual example is\narrays. In\nnon-self-describing formats a Vec needs to be serialized with its length in\norder to be able to deserialize a Vec back out. But a [T; 16] can be\nserialized using serialize_seq_fixed_size because the length will be known at\ndeserialization time without looking at the serialized bytes.\nFinally, serialize_some and serialize_none correspond to Option::Some and\nOption::None. Users tend to have different expectations around the Option\nenum compared to other enums. Serde JSON will serialize Option::None as null\nand Option::Some as just the contained value.\n"},"impl-deserialize.html":{"url":"impl-deserialize.html","title":"Implementing Deserialize","keywords":"","body":"Implementing Deserialize\nThe Deserialize trait\nlooks like this:\npub trait Deserialize: Sized {\n    fn deserialize(deserializer: D) -> Result\n        where D: Deserializer;\n}\n\nThis method's job is to provide the\nDeserializer with a\nVisitor that can be\ndriven by the Deserializer to construct an instance of your type.\nIn most cases Serde's codegen is able to generate an appropriate\nimplementation of Deserialize for structs and enums defined in your crate.\nShould you need to customize the deserialization behavior for a type in a way\nthat codegen does not support, you can implement Deserialize yourself.\nImplementing Deserialize for a type tends to be more complicated than\nimplementing Serialize.\nThe Deserializer trait supports two entry point styles which enables different\nkinds of deserialization.\n\nThe deserialize method. Self-describing data formats like JSON are able to\nlook at the serialized data and tell what it represents. For example the JSON\ndeserializer may see an opening curly brace ({) and know that it is seeing\na map. If the data format supports Deserializer::deserialize, it will drive\nthe Visitor using whatever type it sees in the input. JSON uses this approach\nwhen deserializing serde_json::Value which is an enum that can represent\nany JSON document. Without knowing what is in a JSON document, we can\ndeserialize it to serde_json::Value by going through\nDeserializer::deserialize.\n\nThe various deserialize_* methods. Non-self-describing formats like Bincode\nneed to be told what is in the input in order to deserialize it. The\ndeserialize_* methods are hints to the deserializer for how to interpret\nthe next piece of input. Non-self-describing formats are not able to\ndeserialize something like serde_json::Value which relies on\nDeserializer::deserialize.\n\n\nWhen implementing Deserialize, you should avoid relying on\nDeserializer::deserialize unless you need to be told by the Deserializer what\ntype is in the input. Know that relying on Deserializer::deserialize means\nyour data type will be able to deserialize from self-describing formats only,\nruling out Bincode and many others.\nThe Visitor trait\nA Visitor is instantiated\nby a Deserialize impl and passed to a Deserializer. The Deserializer then\ncalls a method on the Visitor in order to construct the desired type.\nHere is a Visitor that is able to deserialize a primitive i32 from a variety\nof types.\nstruct I32Visitor;\n\nimpl de::Visitor for I32Visitor {\n    type Value = i32;\n\n    fn expecting(&self, formatter: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {\n        formatter.write_str(\"an integer between -2^31 and 2^31\")\n    }\n\n    fn visit_i8(self, value: i8) -> Result\n        where E: de::Error\n    {\n        Ok(value as i32)\n    }\n\n    fn visit_i32(self, value: i32) -> Result\n        where E: de::Error\n    {\n        Ok(value)\n    }\n\n    fn visit_i64(self, value: i64) -> Result\n        where E: de::Error\n    {\n        use std::i32;\n        if value >= i32::MIN as i64 && value \nThe Visitor trait has lots more methods that are not implemented for\nI32Visitor. Leaving them unimplemented means a type\nerror is\nreturned if they get called. For example I32Visitor does not implement\nVisitor::visit_map, so trying to deserialize an i32 when the input contains a\nmap is a type error.\nDriving a Visitor\nDeserialize a value by passing a Visitor to the given Deserializer. The\nDeserializer will call one of the Visitor methods depending on the input\ndata, which is known as \"driving\" the Visitor.\nimpl Deserialize for i32 {\n    fn deserialize(deserializer: D) -> Result\n        where D: Deserializer\n    {\n        deserializer.deserialize_i32(I32Visitor)\n    }\n}\n\nNote that a Deserializer will not necessarily follow the type hint, so the\ncall to deserialize_i32 does not necessarily mean the Deserializer will call\nI32Visitor::visit_i32. For example JSON treats all signed integer types alike.\nThe JSON Deserializer will call visit_i64 for any signed integer and\nvisit_u64 for any unsigned integer, even if hinted a different type.\nOther examples\n\nDeserializing a map\nDeserializing a struct\n\n"},"unit-testing.html":{"url":"unit-testing.html","title":"Unit testing","keywords":"","body":"Unit testing\nThe serde_test crate provides a\nconvenient concise way to write unit tests for implementations of Serialize\nand Deserialize.\nThe Serialize impl for a value can be characterized by the sequence of\nSerializer calls that\nare made in the course of serializing the value, so serde_test provides a\nToken abstraction which\ncorresponds roughly to Serializer method calls.
