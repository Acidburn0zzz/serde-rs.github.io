 \nSerde\nSerde is a framework for serializing and deserializing Rust data\nstructures efficiently and generically.\nThe Serde ecosystem consists of data structures that know how to serialize and\ndeserialize themselves along with data formats that know how to serialize and\ndeserialize other things. Serde provides the layer by which these two groups\ninteract with each other, allowing any supported data structure to be serialized\nand deserialized using any supported data format.\nDesign\nWhere many other languages rely on runtime reflection for serializing data,\nSerde is instead built on Rust's powerful trait system. A data structure that\nknows how to serialize and deserialize itself is one that implements Serde's\nSerialize and Deserialize traits (or uses Serde's code generation to\nautomatically derive implementations at compile time). This avoids any overhead\nof reflection or runtime type information. In fact in many situations the\ninteraction between data structure and data format can be completely optimized\naway by the Rust compiler, leaving Serde serialization to perform roughly the\nsame speed as a handwritten serializer for the specific selection of data\nstructure and data format.\nData formats\nThe following is a partial list of data formats that have been implemented for\nSerde by the community.\n\nJSON, the ubiquitous JavaScript Object\nNotation used by many HTTP APIs.\nBincode, a compact binary format used\nfor IPC within the Servo rendering engine.\nCBOR, a Concise Binary Object\nRepresentation designed for small message size without the need for version\nnegotiation.\nYAML, a popular human-friendly\nconfiguration language that ain't markup language.\nMessagePack, an efficient binary\nformat that resembles a compact JSON.\nTOML, a minimal configuration\nformat used by Cargo.\nPickle, a format common in the\nPython world.\nHjson, a variant of JSON designed to\nbe readable and writable by humans.\nBSON, the data storage and network\ntransfer format used by MongoDB.\nURL, the x-www-form-urlencoded\nformat.\nXML, the flexible machine-friendly W3C\nstandard. (deserialization only)\nEnvy, a way to deserialize environment\nvariables into Rust structs. (deserialization only)\nRedis, deserialize values from\nRedis when using redis-rs.\n(deserialization only)\n\nData structures\nOut of the box, Serde is able to serialize and deserialize common Rust data\ntypes in any of the above formats. For example String, &str, usize,\nVec, HashMap are all supported. In addition, Serde provides code\ngeneration to #[derive] serialization implementations for structs in your own\nprogram. Using the code generation goes like this:\n#![feature(proc_macro)]\n\n#[macro_use]\nextern crate serde_derive;\n\nextern crate serde_json;\n\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\nstruct Point {\n    x: i32,\n    y: i32,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let point = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };\n\n    // Convert the Point to a JSON string.\n    let serialized = serde_json::to_string(&point).unwrap();\n\n    // Prints serialized = {\"x\":1,\"y\":2}\n    println!(\"serialized = {}\", serialized);\n\n    // Convert the JSON string back to a Point.\n    let deserialized: Point = serde_json::from_str(&serialized).unwrap();\n\n    // Prints deserialized = Point { x: 1, y: 2 }\n    println!(\"deserialized = {:?}\", deserialized);\n}\n\n"},"help.html":{"url":"help.html","title":"Help","keywords":"","body":"Getting help\nSerde developers live in the #serde channel on\nirc.mozilla.org.

It is able to generate implementations for most structs\nincluding ones with elaborate generic types or trait bounds. On rare occasions,\nfor an especially convoluted type you may need to implement the traits\nmanually.\nThere are two different ways of setting up code generation depending on whether\nyour crate will be used with stable released versions of Rust or with unstable\nnightly versions. The approach intended for the nightly compiler takes advantage\nof Rust's experimental support for \"Macros 1.1\" plugins which can only be\nenabled on nightly: #![feature(proc_macro)]. This feature will be stabilized\nin Rust 1.15 in February 2017. The approach intended for the stable compiler\ninstead uses a code generation library called\nSyntex and a Cargo build\nscript to write out the generated code\nto a file and include it into your crate. This approach will not be supported\nafter Rust 1.15 in February 2017.\nThere is also a third hybrid approach which uses Syntex by default but uses a\nCargo feature to\nswitch to Macros 1.1 when running with nightly.\nOne downside of the Syntex (stable) approach is that errors and warnings emitted\nby rustc can sometimes point into the nasty generated code and those can be\ndifficult to trace back to the true source of the problem. We recommend setting\nup the hybrid approach but doing your primary development and debugging using a\nnightly compiler.\n\nCodegen targetting stable compiler\nCodegen targetting nightly compiler\nSupporting both stable and nightly\n\n"},"codegen-stable.html":{"url":"codegen-stable.html","title":"On stable compiler","keywords":"","body":"Codegen targetting stable compiler\nThe current stable Rust release does not support compiler plugins so Serde\ncodegen needs to be done through a Cargo build\nscript along with a code generation\nframework called Syntex to generate Serialize\nand Deserialize implementations. This relatively inconvenient approach will no\nlonger be necessary as Rust's compiler plugin support matures in the future.\nAdvantages of this approach: supports stable (released) Rust compiler\nversions because it does not depend on features that can only be enabled in the\nnightly compiler; also works with nightly.\nDisadvantages of this approach: one-time setup cost of using a build script;\nkeeping all Serde types in their own serde_types.in.rs file is annoying; the\nlarge Syntex dependency increases compilation time; rustc will show certain\ntypes of compiler errors pointing into the nasty generated code rather than to\nwhere the error really is.\nTo start with, here is the Cargo.toml that informs Cargo about the build\nscript:\nCargo.toml\n[package]\nname = \"my-crate\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"Me \"]\nbuild = \"build.rs\"\n\n[build-dependencies]\nserde_codegen = \"0.8\"\n\n[dependencies]\nserde = \"0.8\"\nserde_json = \"0.8\"  # just for the example, not required in general\n\nNext create a file src/serde_types.in.rs to hold all the types for which we\nneed code generation.

The Serializer\ngets to keep track of some state which the Serialize implementation is\nresponsible for passing to each method.\nimpl Serialize for Vec\n    where T: Serialize\n{\n    fn serialize(&self, serializer: &mut S) -> Result\n        where S: Serializer\n    {\n        let mut state = serializer.serialize_seq(Some(self.len()))?;\n        for e in self {\n            serializer.serialize_seq_elt(&mut state, e)?;\n        }\n        serializer.serialize_seq_end(state)\n    }\n}\n\nSerializing a map works the same way but with separate calls\nin the loop for serialize_map_key and serialize_map_value.\nSerializing a struct\nSerde distinguishes between four types of structs. Ordinary\nstructs and tuple\nstructs follow the\nthree-step process of init, elements, end just like a sequence or map. Newtype\nstructs and unit\nstructs are more\nlike primitives.\nData formats are encouraged to treat newtype structs as insignificant wrappers\naround the inner value, serializing just the inner value. See for example\nJSON's treatment of newtype structs.\n// An ordinary struct. Use three-step process:\n//   1. serialize_struct\n//   2. serialize_struct_elt\n//   3. serialize_struct_end\nstruct Color {\n    r: u8,\n    g: u8,\n    b: u8,\n}\n\n// A tuple struct.

Use serialize_newtype_struct.\nstruct Inches(u64);\n\n// A unit struct. Use serialize_unit_struct.\nstruct Instance;\n\nSerializing an enum\nSerializing enum variants is very similar to serializing structs.\nenum E {\n    // Use three-step process:\n    //   1. serialize_struct_variant\n    //   2. serialize_struct_variant_elt\n    //   3. serialize_struct_variant_end\n    Color { r: u8, g: u8, b: u8 },\n\n    // Use three-step process:\n    //   1. serialize_tuple_variant\n    //   2. serialize_tuple_variant_elt\n    //   3. serialize_tuple_variant_end\n    Point2D(f64, f64),\n\n    // Use serialize_newtype_variant.\n    Inches(u64),\n\n    // Use serialize_unit_variant.\n    Instance,\n}\n\nOther special cases\nThere are three more special cases that are part of the Serializer trait.\nThere is a method serialize_bytes which serializes a &[u8]. Some formats\ntreat bytes like any other seq, but some formats are able to serialize bytes\nmore compactly. Currently Serde does not use serialize_bytes in the\nSerialize impl for &[u8] or Vec but once\nspecialization lands in stable\nRust we will begin using it. For now the\nBytes and\nByteBuf wrappers can\nbe used to wrap &[u8] and Vec respectively to call serialize_bytes.\nThere is serialize_seq_fixed_size which is like serialize_seq but for\nsequences where the length does not need to be serialized because it will be\nknown at deserialization time. The usual example is\narrays. In\nnon-self-describing formats a Vec needs to be serialized with its length in\norder to be able to deserialize a Vec back out. But a [T; 16] can be\nserialized using serialize_seq_fixed_size because the length will be known at\ndeserialization time without looking at the serialized bytes.\nFinally, serialize_some and serialize_none correspond to Option::Some and\nOption::None. Users tend to have different expectations around the Option\nenum compared to other enums. Serde JSON will serialize Option::None as null\nand Option::Some as just the contained value.\n"},"impl-deserialize.html":{"url":"impl-deserialize.html","title":"Implementing Deserialize","keywords":"","body":"Implementing Deserialize\nThe Deserialize trait\nlooks like this:\npub trait Deserialize: Sized {\n    fn deserialize(deserializer: &mut D) -> Result\n        where D: Deserializer;\n}\n\nThis method's job is to provide the\nDeserializer with a\nVisitor that can be\ndriven by the Deserializer to construct an instance of your type.\nIn most cases Serde's codegen is able to generate an appropriate\nimplementation of Deserialize for structs and enums defined in your crate.\nShould you need to customize the deserialization behavior for a type in a way\nthat codegen does not support, you can implement Deserialize yourself.\nImplementing Deserialize for a type tends to be more complicated than\nimplementing Serialize.\nThe Deserializer trait supports two entry point styles which enables different\nkinds of deserialization.\n\nThe deserialize method. Self-describing data formats like JSON are able to\nlook at the serialized data and tell what it represents. For example the JSON\ndeserializer may see an opening curly brace ({) and know that it is seeing\na map. If the data format supports Deserializer::deserialize, it will drive\nthe Visitor using whatever type it sees in the input. JSON uses this approach\nwhen deserializing serde_json::Value which is an enum that can represent\nany JSON document. Without knowing what is in a JSON document, we can\ndeserialize it to serde_json::Value by going through\nDeserializer::deserialize.\n\nThe various deserialize_* methods. Non-self-describing formats like Bincode\nneed to be told what is in the input in order to deserialize it. The\ndeserialize_* methods are hints to the deserializer for how to interpret\nthe next piece of input. Non-self-describing formats are not able to\ndeserialize something like serde_json::Value which relies on\nDeserializer::deserialize.\n\n\nWhen implementing Deserialize, you should avoid relying on\nDeserializer::deserialize unless you need to be told by the Deserializer what\ntype is in the input. Know that relying on Deserializer::deserialize means\nyour data type will be able to deserialize from self-describing formats only,\nruling out Bincode and many others.\nThe Visitor trait\nA Visitor is instantiated\nby a Deserialize impl and passed to a Deserializer. The Deserializer then\ncalls a method on the Visitor in order to construct the desired type.\nHere is a Visitor that is able to deserialize a primitive i32 from a variety\nof types.\nstruct I32Visitor;\n\nimpl de::Visitor for I32Visitor {\n    type Value = i32;\n\n    fn visit_i8(&mut self, value: i8) -> Result\n        where E: de::Error\n    {\n        Ok(value as i32)\n    }\n\n    fn visit_i32(&mut self, value: i32) -> Result\n        where E: de::Error\n    {\n        Ok(value)\n    }\n\n    fn visit_i64(&mut self, value: i64) -> Result\n        where E: de::Error\n    {\n        use std::i32;\n        if value >= i32::MIN as i64 && value \nThe Visitor trait has lots more methods that are not implemented for\nI32Visitor. Leaving them unimplemented means a type\nerror is\nreturned if they get called. For example I32Visitor does not implement\nVisitor::visit_map, so trying to deserialize an i32 when the input contains a\nmap is a type error.\nDriving a Visitor\nDeserialize a value by passing a Visitor to the given Deserializer. The\nDeserializer will call one of the Visitor methods depending on the input\ndata, which is known as \"driving\" the Visitor.\nimpl Deserialize for i32 {\n    fn deserialize(deserializer: &mut D) -> Result\n        where D: Deserializer\n    {\n        deserializer.deserialize_i32(I32Visitor)\n    }\n}\n\nNote that a Deserializer will not necessarily follow the type hint, so the\ncall to deserialize_i32 does not necessarily mean the Deserializer will call\nI32Visitor::visit_i32. For example JSON treats all signed integer types alike.\nThe JSON Deserializer will call visit_i64 for any signed integer and\nvisit_u64 for any unsigned integer, even if hinted a different type.\nOther examples\n\nDeserializing a map\nDeserializing a struct\n\n"},"unit-testing.html":{"url":"unit-testing.html","title":"Unit testing","keywords":"","body":"Unit testing\nThe serde_test crate provides a\nconvenient concise way to write unit tests for implementations of Serialize\nand Deserialize.\nThe Serialize impl for a value can be characterized by the sequence of\nSerializer calls that\nare made in the course of serializing the value, so serde_test provides a\nToken abstraction which\ncorresponds roughly to Serializer method calls.

This involves parsing Rust\nsource code, applying the expansions, and writing the expanded Rust code out to\na file as part of a Cargo build\nscript.\nThe Rust compiler uses a private library called\nlibsyntax to\nparse source code during ordinary compilation. There is a way to hook into\nlibsyntax from a crate but only when using a nightly compiler:\n#![feature(rustc_private)]. Syntex therefore copies the entire libsyntax\nlibrary into a crate called\nsyntex_syntax, backporting the\nnightly compiler's parser so it can be used on older stable compilers. This copy\nof libsyntax accounts for the slow compilation associated with Syntex, typically\naround 60 seconds when building from scratch.\nSyntex expansion has two main limitations:\n\nCertain types of compiler errors will be reported as occuring within the nasty\ngenerated code rather than the original source code, even if the problem is\npresent in the original.\nSyntex is not able to expand macros it is responsible for inside of macros it\nis not responsible for (including built-in macros like vec![] and\nprintln!()).
